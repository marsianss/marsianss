In my free time, I'm often gaming, or spending lots of time in the gym!

My favorite games to play at the moment are Overwatch 2 with friends, Stardew Valley, & Star Wars BF2.
My best lifts are a 220kg squat, a 147,5kg bench, and 245kg deadlift across two competitions (Lichtstad Cup & NK Junioren)!
